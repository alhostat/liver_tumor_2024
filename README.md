# Liver Tumor Analysis

This is the liver tumor analysis 2024

## Activating the virtual environment

After cloning the project, users may use the R console command:
```
>renv::activate()
>renv::restore()
```
to activate virtual environment and then restoring the environment to download all the right packages from the list in renv.lock

## Files:

The key markdown file is `R/Alan_Ho_Liver_Tumor_2024.qmd` which should be runnable after restoring the environment. The only other thing that may require additional setup is the tinytex / latex engines that may need to be configured on the users' PC.
